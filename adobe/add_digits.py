258 Add Digits

Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

Example 1:

Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
Example 2:

Input: num = 0
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

0 <= num <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

基本思想

n mod 9 = (d_0 + d_1 + ... + d_k) mod 9

where d_i is the i-th digit in number

class Solution:
    def addDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        if num == 0:
            return 0
        if num % 9 == 0:
            return 9
        return num % 9
