A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Write an SQL query to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Explanation: 
In the IT department:
- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:
- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees

row_number() over (partition by E2.DepartmentID order by E2.Salary desc)是关键
注意为了保证distinct需要先嵌套一层
*/

SELECT D.Name as Department, E4.Name as Employee, E3.Salary
FROM
    (SELECT E2.Salary, E2.DepartmentID, 
        row_number() over (partition by E2.DepartmentID order by E2.Salary desc) as S_rank
    FROM
        (SELECT DISTINCT E.Salary, E.DepartmentID
        FROM Employee E) E2
    ) E3, Department D, Employee E4
WHERE E4.DepartmentID = D.Id
AND E4.DepartmentID = E3.DepartmentID
AND E4.Salary = E3.Salary
AND E3.S_rank <= 3
ORDER BY D.Name, S_rank DESC;
